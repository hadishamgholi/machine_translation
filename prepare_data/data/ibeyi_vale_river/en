(Singing) Naomi Diaz:
You were born under a star.


In the sky, she lives now.


Protecting you,


night after night.


(Singing) Lisa-Kaindé Díaz:
Listen to the lullaby


every time life seems to hurt.


So close your eyes,


just close your eyes.


Our voices will hug you,


music be our arms.


The star will shine
and enlighten your night.


You are loved,


little girl, you are.


I bet you'll be stronger
when the day is back.


(Singing) Ibeyi: Waye waye lo mio,


waye kalamefa.


Waye waye lo mio,


waye kalamefa.


Waya kalamefa,

waya kalamefao.


(Singing) ND: If one day you want to cry,


look at the star,


I know she's proud


of who you've been


and who you are.


(Singing) LKD: Then run


into laughing arms


and shine


as bright as you can.


You've been loved —


(Singing) ND: You still are.


(Singing) LKD: Our voices will hug you,


music be our arms.


The star will shine
and enlighten your night.


You are loved,


little girl, you are.


I bet you'll be stronger


when the day is back.

Let me baptize my soul
with the help of your waters.


Sink my pains and complains,


let the river take them,


river drown them.


My ego and my blame —

with the help of your waters.


Those old me's, so ashamed,


let the river take them,


river drown them.
